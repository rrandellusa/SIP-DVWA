## DVWA(Damn Vulnerable Web App)
The Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL-based platform designed to help security professionals hone their skills in a safe, legal environment. It also serves as a learning tool for web developers, students, and educators to better understand web application security.

DVWA allows users to explore common web vulnerabilities at varying difficulty levels through an intuitive interface. While the platform has both documented and undocumented flaws, this is by design, encouraging users to uncover and exploit as many issues as possible to enhance their learning experience.
